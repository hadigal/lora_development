# This repo maintains all the mqtt applications written in C for marconi server and conduit gateway
- For more info follow this link: https://github.com/hadigal/lora_development#2-mqtt-client-server-development
- I created a flow on NodeRed application of conduit gateway to send the message published from marconi to mDot
- Used mqtt input node and configured the node to the values for marconi server hosting the mqtt broker
- Used a lora output node with DevID configured for the desired mDot
- The string message was then received in one of the receive windows by the mdot.
- The flow for the nodeRed is as seen below:
  * ![NodeRed Flow sheet. On  the right most colum we can see the debug log showing the message from marconi](https://github.com/hadigal/lora_development/blob/master/mqtt/marconi_mdot_logs/nodered_mqtt_lora.png)

- A snippet of screen log for mdot is as below:
